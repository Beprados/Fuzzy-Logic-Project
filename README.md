# Fuzzy-Logic-Project
Codes for computing design in Fuzzy Logic. Implements the Fuzzy Adaptive Differential Evolution (FaDE) algorithm, first presented in the paper by Liu and Lampinen. In particular, the technique introduces a Fuzzy Logic System for self-regulation of optimization parameters at runtime. Some test functions are defined in order to define a minimum set of parameters for performance comparison with the original version of Differential Evolution.
